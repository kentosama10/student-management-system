This code is a PHP script that creates a Student Management System. It allows users to view a list of students stored in a database, search for a specific student by name, and view the details of a selected student. It also provides functionality for users to log in and log out of the system. The data is displayed in a table with columns for the student's details, first name, and last name. The code uses a session to keep track of whether a user is logged in or not, and implements a search function by calling a separate PHP file and passing data through GET parameters.
